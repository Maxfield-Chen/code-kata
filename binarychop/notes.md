# What kind of Errors

## recursive chop
  Forgot to track the index changes and resulting type issues. Caught by compiler!
  Fractional vs Int
  base case of no elements took a minute to match on
  Maybe do the base case first

## Functional Chop
  Figuring out which functions you can and cannot use on infinite lists is a lot of mental overhead
  Parsing the final result from an infinite series felt difficult (where to stop)
    Stopping when the list is a single element is not immediately intuitive (0 or 1 elements?)
  stronger desire to break out functionality into smaller functions to pattern match arguments
  forgot to check for empty list
